an array is a simple collection of things they are very powerful data structures that stores list of elements and 
they have endless applications

In simple terms, an array is a collection of
elements of the same data type that are stored 
together in a contiguous block of memory and can be 
accessed using an index or a key. It is a fundamental data 
structure in computer science and is used to store and 
manipulate large amounts of data efficiently. An array can be 
one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or multi-dimensional, 
depending on the number of indices required to access its elements.
